# Diabetes Prediction Using MLP, XGBoost, and TabNet

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a combination of machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset is explored through visualizations, and three models—MLP, XGBoost, and TabNet—are implemented and evaluated to determine their predictive performance.

## Overview
The project analyzes the diabetes.csv dataset to:
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Predict diabetes using three models:
  * MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
  * XGBoost
  * TabNet
* Evaluate the models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

## Features
1. Exploratory data analysis:
    * Histograms
    * Correlation heatmaps
    * Class distribution analysis

2. Implementation of three models:
    * Baseline MLP
    * XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning
    * TabNet with deep learning

3. Comprehensive model evaluation:
    * Accuracy scores
    * Confusion matrices
    * ROC curves

## Results
1. MLP:
    * Accuracy: 75%
2. XGBoost:
    * Accuracy: 79%
3. TabNet:
    * Accuracy: 80%
